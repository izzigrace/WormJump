# Worm Jump

**Worm Jump** is an endless runner game developed using Swift, SpriteKit, and Core Data. In this game, you control a worm who must navigate through a grassy terrain filled with obstacles like rocks and flowers. The objective is to survive as long as possible by jumping over obstacles and collecting droplets to buy hats for your worm character.

## Features
